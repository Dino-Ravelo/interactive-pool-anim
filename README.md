# interactive-pool-anim
The augmented pool project is an interactive platform for learning mathematics and physics through play. This repo stores code-based animations, which purpose is to make the game funnier, more aesthetic and more enjoyable in order to improve the user experience.

For the moment, it mainly targets middle school, high school and college students. Its challenge is to make learning fun and therefore to improve it by anchoring it more deeply in the user.

Equipped with a video projector and a camera, a program is capable of analyzing the context of the game in real time and of projecting information overlaid. Most of the software and hardware functions are currently deployed, with additional learning games coming, as well as a screen next to the pool table showing the table and information about these games.

The current development of the project consists of integrating gamification into the platform, and improving the user experience to allow a better quality of learning of mathematics and physics through games.


**My Mission**

My mission is to produce videos & animations that will make the game even more fun, aesthetic and enjoyable in order to improve the user experience.

For example, you will have to make videos that reproduce the action of a cane that hits the white ball that hits a ball that goes into a hole. Ideally, these videos would be configurable according to the situation: if the ball entering the hole was red, it would therefore be red in the video. It is my mission to find solutions to make and edit these adaptable videos.

It will then be necessary to make videos according to the gamification games that remain to be invented. These videos will entertain the user while teaching them the point of the game theyâ€™re playing.

Finally, when the project is well advanced, I will be in charge of producing a promotional video of the project.


**My deliveries**

My contribution will be materialized by a whole panoply of animated visuals integrated into the billiard table (by a colleague) which will increase tenfold the fun and educational aspects of augmented billiards. These visuals will be delivered to be integrated into the screen.

**Success Criteria Points**

Produce customizable animation videos which adapts according to the color of the ball, its starting position, and the hole it ends in
**x4**
Produce a customizable animation video representing an explosion on one of the holes
**x2**
Produce a customizable animation video representing an overview of the table, while showing a score
**x2**
Produce a customizable animation video projecting a dynamic and variable cone (size-wise)  from the tip of the cue stick, in order to represent a set of possible trajectories
